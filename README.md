# phpFinal
My final project for my php class:

The requirements for my final were a bit vague - they made it sound like I needed to design an entirely new, normalized database, and merge two different databases into it. 

It turns out that wasn't what I was supposed to do, so my quick fix was to restructure/rename all the merged tables after every other procedure was carried out to bring the database back to the original Hawkeye structure. I know this isn't best practice, but my instructor was willing to accept the fix since I'd already done the entire project.
